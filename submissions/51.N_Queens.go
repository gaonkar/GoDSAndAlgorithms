/*
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.


 look at chess board from left to right (a=1, h = 8)
 We can try out all possible values starting from cell(1,1)--> cell(8,8)

 Suppose, we pick cell(0,4), then all columsn=4 is invalid, we use C map to track that
 now [1,5], [2,6] so on are invalid, so 0-4 == 1-5 == 2-6, so we track that in N map
 also [1,3] [2,2] are invalid --> 1+3 == 2+2 == 0+4 is invalid, we track that in M map

 now thats a recursion on what not to choose, since x is always incremented, we dont have to
 worry about it
