/*
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

/*
 Solution:
  Lets define DP[i][j] be equal to the money required for guessing a number thats in the range i to j
  We pick a number x, we end up paying x, but now what is the worst we have to pay that would be
    Max(DP[i][x-1], DP[x+1][j]) + x
  So for we now know thats the cost of choosing x in range i to j. We now try all values from i to j
  to come up with minimum that we could choose.
  for x = i; x <= j; x++ {
     //find value of choosing x,
     pick the minimum value
  }
}
